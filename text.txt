Early concepts gave Sonic fangs and put him in a band with a human girlfriend named Madonna, ideas scrapped by Sega of America to keep his identity simple.[38][23] To further help sell the idea to Sega, Ohshima pitched a backstory, influenced by World War II-era jackets, framed by a fictional American fighter pilot that had earned the name "Hedgehog", later reflected by the emblem design seen in most Sonic games.[27] Sonic's proportions were adjusted for Sonic the Hedgehog 2, with the original head-to-height ratio changed from 1:2 to 1:2.5.[39] During the series' early years, Western material did some modifications to his design, such as sharper eyes and a mohawk-like hairstyle, but these were slowly phased out as the Japanese canon became the standard.
